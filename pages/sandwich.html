            <h1>ITALIAN BEEF SANDWICHES</h1>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Pulled from the classic Better Homes Cookbook, this sandwich delivers with 
                tender beef and rich blend of flavors throughout. For best results, I would
                not even bother trying to cook this on high for shorter periods (though the
                instructions are there if you so choose), as the beef tends to still have a
                toughness to it. Serves roughly 8 sandwiches, depending on size of roast
                and how stuffed you like your sandwich.
            </p>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Trim excessive fat along outside of beef.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in skillet.</li>
                <li>Coat beef with garlic pepper seasoning and brown all sides on heated skillet.</li>
                <li>Place meat in crockpot. It may be necessary to cut meat in half to fit.</li>
                <li>Whisk together beef broth, italian dressing  mix, onion salt, oregano, basil, and parsley.</li>
                <li>Pour over meat in crockpot.</li>

                <li>Cover and cook on low for 10 hours.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Note: Can be done on high for 5-6hours, but would not recommend as the beef 
                            does not come out nearly as tender.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Shred in crockpot.</li>
                <li>Serve in hoagie buns, topped with cheese and more pepperoncini. Drizzle cooking liquid
                    for additional flavor and to melt cheese.
                </li>
            </ol>
